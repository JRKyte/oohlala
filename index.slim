        p …for all things hair and beauty. Granting wishes in the form of hairstyling and makeup.
        p I am Katie Bolt and have spent the last ten years specializing in creating bespoke bridal and event hair in Ibiza. My passion is to make each client feel a million dollars and I believe that everybody deserves some glamour and magic in their life.

        p Hair up and styling is what makes me happy and bridal hair is my thing.  Being part of such a special event is a total honor and my goal is that each and every customer is left feeling a zillion percent their most gorgeous, confident and fabulous self!
        p I take my profession very seriously and strive to stay on my A game with focused wedding and vintage hair courses from elite educators at the Vidal Sassoon Academy, Steiner of London and the Contemporary Academy among others. Always learning and keeping it fresh.
        p Ibiza is home to so many creative and talented souls and I have worked hard to bring together artists and stylist that I admire, and know how to deliver the goods, while putting you first.
